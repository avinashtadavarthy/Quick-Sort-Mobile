## About the Mobile Application

QuickSort Mobile was built using Flutter, a framework based on Dart by Google to help developers build mobile applications for Android and iOS simultaneously with the same codebase. The application:

- Was built with simple re-usable UI components accessible via the lib/widgets folder.
- Reads directly from json files without any helper classes (PODOs).
